# fraction-chess
 
This is a personal project based off an idle thought. It's currently not functional, but here's a rough roadmap:

- Fully implement standard ndarray chessboard
- Implement basic chess moves on this board
- Replace ndarray with graph, where each node is a square
- Rebuild chess moves to function on graph nodes
- Begin to arbitrarily mutate the chessboard via inserting and deleting nodes and edges....
